                <p>
                    Industry Salon Lounge was preparing to open its doors in Newtown Square with a clear goal: create a
                    salon experience that felt elevated, welcoming, and modern from the very first touchpoint. As a brand-
                    new business, their website needed to do more than exist— it needed to introduce the salon, communicate
                    their aesthetic, and support a smooth opening.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this phase, the owners recognized that their existing setup didn't fully reflect the quality
                    or direction of the salon, and a transition was needed to align their digital presence with their vision.

                <h2 class="project-metric">Crafting the Experience</h2>
                <p>
                    Stepping in during the final stages before launch, the focus was on creating a seamless transition
                    from the previous platform to a fully custom website without disrupting the momentum of opening a new
                    business. The site was designed to feel refined yet approachable, mirroring the lounge-style atmosphere
                    of the salon itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From layout and typography to performance and usability, every element was built with clarity, ease,
                    and longevity in mind. The result was a streamlined experience that allows clients to quickly understand
                    the brand, explore services, and feel confident booking from their very first visit.

                    that matched the energy and intention of the physical space. With a modern design, clear structure,
                    and flexible foundation for future growth, the site now supports the salon's brand as it continues to grow.

                    start strong with a website built to grow with them.
